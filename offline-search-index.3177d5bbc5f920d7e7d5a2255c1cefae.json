These clients are not the StoRM clients but the general purpose SRM clients and can be use to contact any Web Service implementing the SRM interface. This document provides some examples of the main functionalities of the SRM specification v2.2.\nBasic concepts In order to use the SRM services you need:\n A valid personal certificate (so you have to do a voms-proxy-init or a grid-proxy-init). A SRM endpoint to contact. to be authorized to contact the SRM.  SRM endpoint Generally a SRM endpoint is in the form:\nhttpg://host:port/service_path (or http, https).  The endpoint that we use in all the following examples is:\nhttpg://ibm139.cnaf.infn.it:8444/  For this endpoint the service path can be left blank.\nSURL A file (or a directory) is identified by a SURL that has the following format:\nsrm://host[:port]/[soap_end_point_path?SFN=]site_file_name  where […] means optional. The sfile ite_file_name must begin with a StFN root. The StFN root must be agreed with the SRM administrator. An example of SURL is:\nsrm://ibm139.cnaf.infn.it:8444/infngrid/test_file.txt  In this example the StFN root is infngrid and the file name is test_file.txt. If the SRM requires a service path, the previous example becomes:\nsrm://ibm139.cnaf.infn.it:8444/srm/managerv2?SFN=/infngrid/test_file.txt  where the service path is srm/managerv2. According to the last example the SRM endpoint should be:\nhttpg://ibm139.cnaf.infn.it:8444/srm/managerv2  StoRM clientSRM The clientSRM is the binary of the SRM v2.2 Command Line Client. The client can be used to interact with any SRM v2.2 endpoint.\nInstallation To install storm-srm-client, install its metapackage RPM: emi-storm-srm-client-mp\n$ yum install emi-storm-srm-client-mp  Examples The following are several examples of clientSRM use.\nsrmPing Check the state of the SRM.\nThis function works as an “are you alive” type of call. The version of the SRM specification implemented by the server is returned. To ping a SRM server using the provided SRM client type:\n$ clientSRM Ping -e httpg://ibm139.cnaf.infn.it:8444/  The server responds with the implemented SRM

The SRM protocol does not do any data transfer. The protocol is used to ask a Mass Storage System (MSS) to make a file ready for transfer, or to create space in a disk cache to which a file can be uploaded. The file is then transferred to or from a Transfer URL or TURL.\nRead more:\n The Storage Resource Manager Interface Specification Version 2.2  StoRM typical deployment StoRM implements the SRM version 2.2 data management specification and is typically deployed on top of a cluster file system like IBM GPFS. StoRM has a layered architecture (Figure 1), split between two main components: the StoRM frontend and backend services. The StoRM frontend service implements the SRM interface exposed to client applications and frameworks. The StoRM backend service implements the actual storage management logic by interacting directly with the underlying file system. Data transfer is provided by GridFTP, HTTP/WebDAV and XRootD services accessing directly the file system underlying the StoRM deployment. StoRM WebDAV, besides HTTP data transfer functionality, also provides a WebDAV-based data management interface.\nStoRM supports tape through integration with GEMSS, a tape library manager component also developed at INFN-CNAF.\nStoRM provides flexible AuthN/Z support:\n VOMS \u0026 OAuth tokens (WebDAV \u0026 CDMI) File access control is enforced via POSIX ACLs  ","excerpt":"StoRM is a lightweight storage resource manager (SRM) solution …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/overview/","title":"StoRM Architecture Overview"},{"body":"The file /etc/storm/backend-server/storm.properties contains StoRM Backend configuration.

One of the information stored into namespace.xml file is what is needed to perform the mapping functionality. The mapping functionality is the process of retrieving or building the transport URL (TURL) of a file addressed by a Site URL (SURL) together with grid user credential.\nThe following schema shows the different schema of SURL and TURL:\nA couple of quick concepts from SRM:\n The SURL is the logical identifier for a local data entity Data access and data transfer are made through the TURLs The TURL identify a physical location of a replica SRM services retrieve the TURL from a namespace database (like DPNS component in DPM) or build it through other mechanisms (like StoRM)  In StoRM, the mapping functionality is provided by the namespace component (NS).\n The Namespace component works without a database. The Namespace component is based on an XML configuration. It relies on the physical storage structure.  The basic features of the namespace component are:\n The configuration is modular and structured (representation is based on XML) An efficient structure of namespace configuration lives in memory. No access to disk or database is performed The loading and the parsing of the configuration file occurs:  at start-up of the back-end service when configuration file is modified    StoRM is different from the other solution, where typically, for every SRM request a query to the data base have to be done in order to establish the physical location of file and build the correct transfer URL. The namespace functions relies on two kind of parameters for mapping operations derived from the SRM requests, that are:\n the grid user credential (a subject or a service acting on behalf of the subject) the SURL  The Fig.4 shows the main concepts of Namespace Component:\n NS-Filesystem: is the representation of a Storage Area Mapping rule: represents the basic rule for the mapping functionalities Approachable rule: represents the coarse grain access control to the Storage Area.

Within the pool element pool members are declared identified by their id, the list of members have to be homogenious with respect to their schema. This id is the server identifier specified in the prot element. The balance-strategy represent the load balancing strategy with which the pool has to be managed. Possible values are: round-robin, smart-rr, random and weight.  NOTE: Protocol server pooling is currently available only for gsiftp servers.  Load balancing strategies details:\n  round-robin At each TURL construction request the strategy returns the next server following the round-robin approach: a circular list with an index starting from the head and incrementd at each request.\n  smart-rr An enhanced version of round-robin. The status of pool members is monitored and maintained in a cache. Cache entries has a validity life time that is refreshed when expired. If the member chosen by round-robin is marked as not responsive another iteration of round-robin is performed.\n  random At each TURL construction request the strategy returns a random member of the pool.\n  weight An enhanced version of round-robin. When a server is chosen the list index will not be moved forward (and the server will be choosen again in next request) for as many times as specified in its weight.\n  NOTE: The weight has to be specified in a weight element inside the member element:\n\u003cpool\u003e \u003cbalance-strategy\u003eWEIGHT\u003c/balance-strategy\u003e \u003cmembers\u003e \u003cmember member-id=\"0\"\u003e \u003cweight\u003e5\u003c/weight\u003e \u003c/member\u003e \u003cmember member-id=\"1\"\u003e \u003cweight\u003e1\u003c/weight\u003e \u003c/member\u003e \u003c/members\u003e \u003c/pool\u003e Storage space information default values \u003cdefaults-values\u003e \u003cspace lifetime=\"86400\" type=\"volatile\" guarsize=\"291\" totalsize=\"291\"/\u003e \u003cfile lifetime=\"3600\" type=\"volatile\"/\u003e \u003c/defaults-values\u003e Mapping rules A mapping rule define how a certain NS-Filesystem, that correspond to a Storage Area in SRM meaning of terms, is exposed in Grid:\n\u003cmapping-rules\u003e \u003cmap-rule name=\"dteam-maprule\"\u003e \u003cstfn-root\u003e/dteam\u003c/stfn-root\u003e \u003cmapped-fs\u003edteam-FS\u003c/mapped-fs\u003e \u003c/map-rule\u003e \u003c/mapping-rules\u003e The \u003cstfn-root\u003e is the path used to build SURL referring to that Storage Area. The mapping rule above define that the NS-Filesystem named dteam-FS has to be mapped in the /dteam SURL path. Following the NS-Filesystem element defined in the previous section, the SURL:\nsrm://storm-fe.cr.cnaf.infn.it:8444/dteam/testfile  following the root expressed in the dteam-FS NF-Filesystem element, is mapped in the physical root path on the file system:\n/storage/dteam  This approach works similar to an alias, from the SURL stfn-root path to the NS-Filesystem root.\nApproachable rules Approachable rules defines which users (or which class of users) can approach a certain Storage Area, always expressed as NS-Filesystem element. If a user can approach a Storage Area, he can use it for all SRM operations. If a user is not allowed to approach a Storage Area, and he try to specify it in any SRM request, he will receive an SRM_INVALID_PATH. In practics, if a user cannot approach a Storage Area, for him that specific path does not exists at all.

Here you can define regular expression on DN fields to define more complex approachable rules.\n  \u003cvo-name\u003edteam\u003c/vo-name\u003e means that only users belonging to the VO dteam will be allowed to access the Storage Area. This entry can be a list of comma separeted VO-name.\n  Used space initialization An administrator can initialize the status of a Storage Area by editing a configuration file, the used-space.ini configuration file, that it’s parsed once at Backend’s bootstrap time.

StoRM WebDAV, besides HTTP data transfer functionality, also provides a WebDAV-based data management interface.\nPrerequisites Platform All the StoRM components are certified to work on CentOS 7. There are no specific minimum hardware requirements but it is advisable to have at least 4GB of RAM on Backend host.\nACL support StoRM uses the ACLs on files and directories to implement the security model. To do this, StoRM uses the native access to the file system. Therefore, in order to ensure a proper running, ACLs need to be enabled on the underlying file-system and work properly (sometimes they are enabled by default).\nIf the getfacl and setfacl commands are not available on your host you have to install acl package:\nyum install acl To check if all works properly, try to set an acl to a test file as follow:\ntouch test setfacl -m u:storm:rw test Note: storm local user must exist.\ngetfacl test Should return the following values:\n# file: test # owner: root # group: root user::rw- user:storm:rw- group::r-- mask::rw- other::r-- To enable ACLs (if needed), you must add the acl property to the relevant file system in your /etc/fstab file. For example:\n/dev/hda3 /storage ext3 defaults, acl 1 2 Then you need to remount the affected partitions as follows:\nmount -o remount /storage This is valid for different file system types (i.e., ext3, xfs, gpfs and others).\nExtended Attribute support StoRM uses the Extended Attributes (EA) on files to store some metadata related to the file (e.g. the checksum value); therefore in order to ensure a proper running, the EA support needs to be enabled on the underlying file system and work properly.\nIf the getfattr and setfattrl commands are not available on your host, install attr package:\nyum install attr To check if all properly works, try to set an extendend attribute to a test file:\ntouch testfile setfattr -n user.testea -v test testfile getfattr -d testfile It should return:\n# file: testfile user.testea=\"test\" To enable EA (if needed) you must add the user_xattr property to the relevant file systems in your /etc/fstab file. For example:\n/dev/hda3 /storage ext3 defaults,acl,user_xattr 1 2 Then you need to remount the affected partitions as follows:\nmount -o remount /storage FQDN Hostname Hostname must be a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).\nTo check if your hostname is a FQDN, run:\nhostname -f The command must return the host FQDN.\nIf you need to correct it and you are using bind or NIS for host lookups, you can change the FQDN and the DNS domain name, which is part of the FQDN, in the /etc/hosts file.\n# Do not remove the following line, or various programs # that require network functionality will fail. 127.0.0.1 MYHOSTNAME.MYDOMAIN MYHOSTNAME localhost.localdomain localhost ::1 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6 Set your own MYHOSTNAME and MYDOMAIN and restart the network service:\nservice network restart Host credentials Hosts participating to the StoRM-SE which run services such as StoRM Frontend, StoRM Backend, StoRM WebDAV or StoRM Globus GridFTP must be configured with X.509 certificates signed by a trusted Certification Authority (CA).\nUsually, the hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem certificate and private key are located in the /etc/grid-security directory. They must have permission 0644 and 0400 respectively:\nls -l /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem -r-------- 1 root root 887 Mar 1 17:08 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem ls -l /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1440 Mar 1 17:08 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem Check if your certificate is expired as follow:\nopenssl x509 -checkend 0 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem To change permissions, if necessary:\nchmod 0400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem chmod 0644 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem NTP service NTP service must be installed and running.\nyum install ntp systemctl enable ntpd systemctl start ntpd ","excerpt":"StoRM is a lightweight storage resource manager (SRM) solution …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/storm-docs/releases/frontend/","title":"StoRM Frontend Releases"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

It takes care of ensuring that different individuals on the Grid remain distinct Unix accounts. Using group mappings based on the user’s VO attributes, isolation and scheduling priority decisions can be made.\n See more on https://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/LCMAPS\n This mapping can be configured via YAIM through the variables USERS_CONF and GROUPS_CONF. These variables contain the full absolute path of a couple of files: users.conf and groups.conf.\nThe file users.conf contains the list of Linux users (pool accounts) to be created. It’s a plain list of the users and their IDs. An example of this configuration file can be found into:\n/opt/glite/yaim/examples/users.conf More details can be found in the User configuration section in the YAIM guide.\nThe UNIX users here defined must be created on the service nodes that need them (mainly CE and WNs). The format is the following (fields must not have any white space):\nUID:LOGIN:GID1[,GID2,...]:GROUP1[,GROUP2,...]:VO:FLAG:  UID = user ID. This must be a valid uid. Make sure the number you choose is not assigned to another user. LOGIN = login name GID1 = primary group ID. This must be a valid gid. Make sure the number you choose is not assigned to another group. GID2 = secondary group ID. GROUP1 = primary group GROUP2 = secondary group VO = virtual organization FLAG = string to identify special users, further described below  You can customize this file to your site needs.\nThe groups.conf file defines the user categories that must be accepted by the grid services provided by a site. It indicates for each category to which kind of local accounts the user should be mapped, where applicable. The file has the following format:\n\"VOMS_FQAN\":GROUP:GID:FLAG:[VO]  VOMS_FQAN = VOMS proxy fully qualified attribute name GROUP = UNIX group GID = UNIX GID FLAG = string to identify special users, further described below VO = virtual organization (optional. It allows the VO to be specified explicitly, otherwise it will be derived from the VOMS FQAN  The groups.conf distributed by YAIM is only an example. You can remove the lines that doesn’t apply to your site or VO and add new lines if needed. Example:\n\"/dteam/ROLE=lcgadmin\":::sgm: \"/dteam/ROLE=production\":::prd: \"/dteam\":::: The groups.conf file lists the VOMS proxy primary FQANs that are accepted. If a proxy has a secondary FQAN that matches one of the FQANs listed, the mapped account may receive an extra secondary GID corresponding to the matched FQAN. That GID normally is derived from the corresponding accounts in the users.conf file. If there are no accounts dedicated to that FQAN, the desired extra GID (if any) and GROUP name must be given in groups.conf. Note that:\n it is normal for the second and third fields to be empty, as shown in the example; the account corresponding to the primary FQAN does not have to belong to any secondary group: the LCMAPS library can set secondary groups independently of what is in /etc/group; the order of the lines in groups.conf is important: for any FQAN only the first match is taken  The FLAG selects a set of special accounts to be used for the mapping, namely those accounts in users.conf that have the same flag. By default, when the flag is empty, the ordinary pool accounts will be used.\nExample Configure users and groups mapping We want to create the following pool accounts:\n a pool account of 100 users with group name testvo and test.vo as VO name a pool account of 30 production users with group name testvoprd, test.vo as VO name and prd as FLAG.

The Scheduler takes care of forward the request to the right worker thread as a new task to be executed. The request status is updated into the Database with all the information concerining request results, error and other data. This data are accessible from the FE to answer to a srmStatusOf* request. This pattern is shown in the following picture:\nMost of the parameters characterizing this architecture are configurable.\nFile System driver StoRM interacts with the different file systems supported through a driver mechanism. Each driver is a native library written mainly in C/C++, since most of the file system provides C libraries for the advanced API. StoRM Backend uses JNI to connect with drivers. The functionalities provided by each driver are:\n ACL management Space management  The drivers available with StoRM are:\n posixfs generic driver for posix file system. It relies on the standard setfacl(), getfacl() syscall for ACL management, and it does not provide any advanced space management capabilities. GPFS specific driver that relies on GPFS advanced API, such as gpfs_prealloc for space management and gpfs_set_acl() for ACL management.  This driver mechanism implements a common interface and decouple StoRM internal logic from the different functionalities provided by the underlying storage system. The drivers are loaded at run time following the storage namespace configuration. A single StoRM server is able to work on different file system at the same time, and with this flexible approach it can be easily adapted to support new kind of file systems or other storage resources.\n","excerpt":"The StoRM Backend component has several responsabilities:\n executes …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/overview/backend/","title":"StoRM Backend"},{"body":"This is the blog section.

Once a request has been authorized, the FE assigns it as a new task for a worker thread. In case there are no free threads in the system, the request is maintained in an internal queue. The size of the pool and the size of the queue are important parameters, their value have to be defined depending on hardware resources and performance required. Depending on the type of SRM request, each thread should have two main task to do, as explained in the next paragraph.\nXML-RPC communication Synchronous SRM requests are a category of SRM calls that return the control to the client only when the request has been executed by the system. Most of the SRM call belongs to this category:\n Namespace operations (srmLs, srmMkdir, etc.) Discovery operation (srmPing) Space operations (srmReserveSpace, srmGetSpaceMetadata, etc.)  For this type of request, the FE perform a direct communication to the Backend using a RPC approach, based on the XML-RPC protocol. XML-RPC is a simple protocol to exchange XML structured data over HTTP. The Backend provides an XML-RPC server and the FE(s) acts as client. A worker threads in case of synchronous requests performs this steps:\n structure the SRM data in XML send a request to the BE XML-RPC server wait until the execution get result from XML and unmarshall it in SOAP return the control to the client  ","excerpt":"Pool of worker threads The FE uses a pool of worker threads to manage …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/overview/frontend/","title":"StoRM Frontend"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

For each SRM request, the authorized VO user is mapped on one local user and group. Knowing this, the system administrator can write a list of ACE (Access Control Entry), evaluated by a selected algorithm, in order to permit or deny to a local user/group a list of operations on a particular path.\nThe choose of the evaluation algorithm and the definition of the list of ACEs can be done by editing the file:\n/etc/storm/backend-server/path-authz.db. Evaluation algorithm The selected evaluation algorithm is indicated by the property algorithm. Its default value is:\nalgorithm=it.grid.storm.authz.path.model.PathAuthzAlgBestMatch  NOTE: Currently, this is the unique supported algorithm that can be specified.\n To determine if a request succeeds, the PathAuthzAlgBestMatch evaluation algorithm processes the ACE list in a computed order:\n only the ACE which have a local UNIX group that matches the requester subject are considered; the order of the ACE is defined on the base of distance from the requested SURL’s StFN and the path specified within the ACE; each ACE is processed until all of the bits of the requester’s access have been checked.  The result will be:\n NOT_APPLICABLE if there are no ACE matching with the requester. INDETERMINATE if there is at least one bit not checked. DENY if there is at least one bit DENIED for the requestor PERMIT if all the bits are PERMIT  Access Control Entries The default ACE stored into path-authz.db authorization file allows every kind of operation on all the storage areas:\n#--------+-----------------------+---------+ # user | Path | Permission | ACE | # class | | mask | type | #--------+-----------------------+---------+ @ALL@ / RLWFDMN permit Each ACE is composed by the following information:\n USER CLASS contains the name of the UNIX group involved or @ALL@ to match all the groups; PATH is the relative sub-path based on the storage area root; the PERMISSION MASK contains from one to all the following letters:  W : WRITE_FILE “Write data on existing files” R : READ_FILE “Read data” F : MOVE/RENAME “Move a file” D : DELETE “Delete a file or a directory” L : LIST_DIRECTORY “Listing a directory” M : CREATE_DIRECTORY “Create a directory” N : CREATE_FILE “Create a new file”   ACE TYPE value could be permit or deny and indicates if the selected operations on that path have to be blocked or allowed.  Example To properly configure StoRM’s Path Authorization DataBase it’s useful to have the right knowledge about the users/groups involved with LCMAPS mapping.\nHere we’re going to show how to configure a simple path authorization filter on our test VO’s storage area: test.vo. The idea is to create:\n a sub-directory test.vo/PRD accessible in read/write mode only by users that belong to the local group testvoprd; a sub-directory test.vo/USERS accessible in read/write mode only by users that belong to the local group testvo but readable by testvoprd users.  Edit:\n/etc/storm/backend-server/path-authz.db  as follow:\n#----------+--------------+------------+--------+ # user | Path | Permission | ACE | # class | | mask | type | #----------+--------------+------------+--------+ testvoprd /test.vo/PRD RLWFDMN permit @ALL@ /test.vo/PRD RLWFDMN deny testvo /test.vo/USERS RLWFDMN permit testvoprd /test.vo/USERS RL permit @ALL@ /test.vo/USERS RLWFDMN deny @ALL@ / RLWFDMN permit This ACE list say that:\n All the users mapped into testvoprd group can do any kind of operation into /test.vo/PRD directory and read/list files into /test.vo/USERS (1st and 4th ACEs); All the users mapped into testvo group can do any kind of operation into /test.vo/USERS directory (3rd ACE); All the user mapped into a group different from testvoprd and testvo can’t access /test.vo/PRD or /test.vo/USERS (2nd and 5th ACEs); No ACEs are defined for the other storage areas (6th ACE).  The order of the ACEs is important because the evaluation algorithm stops after the first match with minimal distance from Path. For example, if we invert the first two rows of our ACE list, nobody will be authorized to read or write into /test.vo/PRD.\nTo apply the changes to path-authz.db you need to restart storm-backend-server:\nsystemctl restart storm-backend-server Users In order to do some test on the path-authz.db configuration showed above, two users with different VOMS attributes have been used:\n /C=IT/O=IGI/CN=test0 /C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Personal Certificate/L=CNAF/CN=Enrico Vianello with “Role=R1”  Supposing the same LCMAPS configuration of this example, user Enrico Vianello will be mapped into testvoprd local group (it has “Role=R1” between its FQANs). User test0 has no “Role=R1” then it will be mapped to testvo local group.\nSRM tests The following tests have been done using:\n gfal tool for the SRM requests globus-url-copy of Globus Toolkit to direct upload/download files acl package (it’s a StoRM prerequisite) to read the ACL set on files/directories  ## Switch to user \"Enrico Vianello\" ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo:/test.vo/Role=R1 --cert vianello-2014.p12 ## Create directory /test.vo/tmp ## $ gfal-mkdir srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/tmp ## Get ACLs from /test.vo/tmp ## $ getfacl /storage/test.vo/tmp getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/tmp # owner: storm # group: storm user::rwx group::--- group:testvoprd:r-x mask::rwx other::--- ## The testvoprd ACL has been added added ## ## Create new local file: ## $ echo \"Hello world!!\" \u003e hello.txt ## Upload local file to /test.vo/tmp ## $ cat hello.txt | gfal-save srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt ## Check if the uploaded file exists: ## $ gfal-ls srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/tmp hello.txt ## Get ACLs from /test.vo/tmp/hello.txt $ getfacl /storage/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt # owner: storm # group: storm user::rw- group::--- group:testvoprd:rw- mask::rwx other::--- ## The testvoprd ACL has been added added ## Switch to test0 user: ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo --cert test0.p12 ## Get file content /test.vo/tmp/hello.txt ## $ gfal-copy srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt file:///tmp/hello.txt Copying 1 [DONE] after 1s ## Check the updated ACL on /test.vo/tmp/hello.txt ## $getfacl /storage/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/tmp/hello.txt # owner: storm # group: storm user::rw- group::--- group:testvo:r-- group:testvoprd:rw- mask::rwx other::--- ## testvo read permission has been added ## Switch to user \"Enrico Vianello\" ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo:/test.vo/Role=R1 --cert vianello-2014.p12 ## Create directory /test.vo/PRD (accessible only to testvoprd users): $ gfal-mkdir srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD ## getting ACLs on /test.vo/PRD $ getfacl /storage/test.vo/PRD/ getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/PRD/ # owner: storm # group: storm user::rwx group::--- group:testvoprd:r-x mask::rwx other::--- ## Upload local file to /test.vo/PRD/hello.txt $ cat hello.txt | gfal-save srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt ## Check if the uploaded file exists: $ gfal-ls srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD hello.txt ## Get ACLs from /test.vo/PRD/hello.txt $ getfacl /storage/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt # owner: storm # group: storm user::rw- group::--- group:testvoprd:rw- mask::rwx other::--- ## The testvoprd ACL has been added added ## Get uploaded file content: $ gfal-cat srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt Hello World!! ## Switch to test0 user: $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo --cert test0.p12 ## Get file content expecting unauthorized failure (1): $ gfal-cat srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt gfal-cat: error: Permission denied ## Get file content expecting unauthorized failure (1): $ gfal-copy srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt file:///tmp/hello.txt Copying 1 [FAILED] after 2s gfal-copy: error: Permission denied At this point a question could be raised: how does it works with direct calls from GridFTP? The GridFTP TURLs should be used only within the context of a SRM request (between a srmPtG and a srmRf or between a srmPtP and a srmPd). In this case there’s no problem because the SRM request will set the necessary ACL (indipendently from the enforcing approach used). If the GridFTP call is made out of the context of a SRM request the scenary depends on the operations done before and on who has done them, or depends on the Default ACL. It’s not sure that the necessary ACL is set (if the enforcing approach is JiT the ACL could even not exist), then the request can fail.\nIn case of AoT enforcing approach, if almost one user mapped on the same group has already done a SRM request on the resource, then a direct access to the same resource, providing the necessary credentials, will be successful.\nFor example, at the point of the example above, if user test0 does a globus-url-copy like the gfal-copy just done, the request will be successful:\n## Switch to user test0 ## ## Check failure on file download passing through StoRM SRM endpoint: ## $ gfal-copy srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/hello.txt file:///tmp/hello.txt Copying 1 [FAILED] after 2s gfal-copy: error: Permission denied ## Resource is not reachable via SRM! ## Check failure on file download by directly accessing via GridFTP ## $ globus-url-copy -vb gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt hello.tx Source: gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/ Dest: file:///home/vianello/ Hello.txt -\u003e hello.tx error: globus_ftp_client: the server responded with an error 500 Command failed. : open error: Permission denied Avoid conflicts with Default ACL List StoRM allows site administrators to set a Default ACL List for each storage area (see backend configuration section of StoRM’s System Administrator guide).\nThe Default ACL List contains one or more pairs of a local user (uid) or group id (gid) and a permission (R, W, RW). All these ACL are automatically added by StoRM to the requested resource, at each read or write request.\nObviously, if the Default ACL involves users or groups that are used also into the path-authz.db, this configuration can generate conflicts and unexpected behaviors.\nFor example, if we add to our test.vo storage area the following default ACL:\nSTORM_TESTVO_DEFAULT_ACL_LIST=testvo:RW  we will give to all the users with group testvo read and write permissions on all the files and directories within the storage area. Default ACL list is propagated onto sub-directories and files when they are created or read by a SRM request. Then, if the site administrator applies it on an already existent filesystem tree, he must manually run a command which fix all the storage area’s ACL.\nGoing back to our example, added the STORM_TESTVO_DEFAULT_ACL_LIST and after a re-run of yaim confguration, we can retry to create/read/delete from test.vo, with the following results:\n## Create test0 VOMS proxy for test.vo ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo --cert test0.p12 ## Check root directory: it's empty ## $ gfal-ls srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/ ## Attempt to create PRD directory: it should fail! ## $ gfal-mkdir srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD gfal-mkdir: error: Permission denied ## Upload file into test.vo:##  $ cat hello.txt | gfal-save srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/Hello.txt ## Switch to user Enrico Vianello ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo:/test.vo/Role=R1 --cert vianello-2014.p12 ... ## Attempt to create PRD directory: a success is expected! $ gfal-mkdir srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD ## Upload file into PRD directory ## $ cat hello.txt | gfal-save srm://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:8444/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt ## Switch to test0 user ## $ voms-proxy-init --voms test.vo --cert test0.p12 ## Download unauthorized file: expected error, success retrieved!! $ globus-url-copy -vb gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt /tmp/Hello.txt Source: gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/ Dest: file:///tmp/ Hello.txt ## just to see the different ACL: $ getfacl /storage/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: storage/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt # owner: storm # group: storm user::rw- group::--- group:testvo:rw- group:testvoprd:rw- mask::rwx other::--- As expected, the new ACE:\ngroup:testvo:rw-  is propagated into all the test.vo sub-directories and allow read operations on files that would be unreadable before:\n$ globus-url-copy -vb gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/Hello.txt /tmp/Hello.txt Source: gsiftp://centos6-devel.cnaf.infn.it:2811/storage/test.vo/PRD/ Dest: file:///tmp/ Hello.txt So, be careful and check both Defualt ACL List and storm-authz.db in order to avoid conflicts.\n","excerpt":"Introduction StoRM Path Authorization Database gives to the system …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/getting-started/backend/path-authz.db/","title":"Configure StoRM Path Authorization Database"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.
