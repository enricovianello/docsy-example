StoRM has a layered architecture (Figure 1), split between two main components: the StoRM frontend and backend services. The StoRM frontend service implements the SRM interface exposed to client applications and frameworks. The StoRM backend service implements the actual storage management logic by interacting directly with the underlying file system. Data transfer is provided by GridFTP, HTTP/WebDAV and XRootD services accessing directly the file system underlying the StoRM deployment. StoRM WebDAV, besides HTTP data transfer functionality, also provides a WebDAV-based data management interface.\nStoRM supports tape through integration with GEMSS, a tape library manager component also developed at INFN-CNAF.\nStoRM provides flexible AuthN/Z support:\n VOMS \u0026 OAuth tokens (WebDAV \u0026 CDMI) File access control is enforced via POSIX ACLs  ","excerpt":"StoRM is a lightweight storage resource manager (SRM) solution …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/overview/","title":"StoRM Architecture Overview"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/storm-docs/releases/backend/","title":"StoRM Backend Releases"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/configuration/how-to/path-authz-db/","title":"Configure path-authz.db"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

One of the information stored into namespace.xml file is what is needed to perform the mapping functionality. The mapping functionality is the process of retrieving or building the transport URL (TURL) of a file addressed by a Site URL (SURL) together with grid user credential.\nThe following schema shows the different schema of SURL and TURL:\nA couple of quick concepts from SRM:\n The SURL is the logical identifier for a local data entity Data access and data transfer are made through the TURLs The TURL identify a physical location of a replica SRM services retrieve the TURL from a namespace database (like DPNS component in DPM) or build it through other mechanisms (like StoRM)  In StoRM, the mapping functionality is provided by the namespace component (NS).\n The Namespace component works without a database. The Namespace component is based on an XML configuration. It relies on the physical storage structure.  The basic features of the namespace component are:\n The configuration is modular and structured (representation is based on XML) An efficient structure of namespace configuration lives in memory. No access to disk or database is performed The loading and the parsing of the configuration file occurs:  at start-up of the back-end service when configuration file is modified    StoRM is different from the other solution, where typically, for every SRM request a query to the data base have to be done in order to establish the physical location of file and build the correct transfer URL. The namespace functions relies on two kind of parameters for mapping operations derived from the SRM requests, that are:\n the grid user credential (a subject or a service acting on behalf of the subject) the SURL  The Fig.4 shows the main concepts of Namespace Component:\n NS-Filesystem: is the representation of a Storage Area Mapping rule: represents the basic rule for the mapping functionalities Approachable rule: represents the coarse grain access control to the Storage Area.

This id is the server identifier specified in the prot element. The balance-strategy represent the load balancing strategy with which the pool has to be managed. Possible values are: round-robin, smart-rr, random and weight.  NOTE: Protocol server pooling is currently available only for gsiftp servers.  Load balancing strategies details:\n  round-robin At each TURL construction request the strategy returns the next server following the round-robin approach: a circular list with an index starting from the head and incrementd at each request.\n  smart-rr An enhanced version of round-robin. The status of pool members is monitored and maintained in a cache. Cache entries has a validity life time that is refreshed when expired. If the member chosen by round-robin is marked as not responsive another iteration of round-robin is performed.\n  random At each TURL construction request the strategy returns a random member of the pool.\n  weight An enhanced version of round-robin.

The mapping rule above define that the NS-Filesystem named dteam-FS has to be mapped in the /dteam SURL path. Following the NS-Filesystem element defined in the previous section, the SURL:\nsrm://storm-fe.cr.cnaf.infn.it:8444/dteam/testfile  following the root expressed in the dteam-FS NF-Filesystem element, is mapped in the physical root path on the file system:\n/storage/dteam  This approach works similar to an alias, from the SURL stfn-root path to the NS-Filesystem root.\nApproachable rules Approachable rules defines which users (or which class of users) can approach a certain Storage Area, always expressed as NS-Filesystem element. If a user can approach a Storage Area, he can use it for all SRM operations. If a user is not allowed to approach a Storage Area, and he try to specify it in any SRM request, he will receive an SRM_INVALID_PATH. In practics, if a user cannot approach a Storage Area, for him that specific path does not exists at all. Here is an example of approachable rule for the dteam-FS element:\n\u003capproachable-rules\u003e \u003capp-rule name=\"dteam-rule\"\u003e \u003csubjects\u003e \u003cdn\u003e*\u003c/dn\u003e \u003cvo-name\u003edteam\u003c/vo-name\u003e \u003c/subjects\u003e \u003capproachable-fs\u003edteam-FS\u003c/approachable-fs\u003e \u003cspace-rel-path\u003e/\u003c/space-rel-path\u003e \u003c/app-rule\u003e \u003c/approachable-rules\u003e   \u003cdn\u003e*\u003c/dn\u003e means that everybody can access the storage Area. Here you can define regular expression on DN fields to define more complex approachable rules.\n  \u003cvo-name\u003edteam\u003c/vo-name\u003e means that only users belonging to the VO dteam will be allowed to access the Storage Area. This entry can be a list of comma separeted VO-name.\n  Used space initialization An administrator can initialize the status of a Storage Area by editing a configuration file, the used-space.ini configuration file, that it’s parsed once at Backend’s bootstrap time.

You must configure either the server or JDBC driver (via the serverTimezone configuration property) to use a more specifc time zone value if you want to utilize time zone support. This bug is tracked at STOR-1397.\nThe possible solutions to avoid this problem are:\n downgrade StoRM Backend to v1.11.19 (recommended) apply a workaround within MariaDB install StoRM Backend v1.11.21 beta  Downgrade StoRM Backend to v1.11.19 RECOMMENDED.

Once a request has been authorized, the FE assigns it as a new task for a worker thread. In case there are no free threads in the system, the request is maintained in an internal queue. The size of the pool and the size of the queue are important parameters, their value have to be defined depending on hardware resources and performance required. Depending on the type of SRM request, each thread should have two main task to do, as explained in the next paragraph.\nXML-RPC communication Synchronous SRM requests are a category of SRM calls that return the control to the client only when the request has been executed by the system. Most of the SRM call belongs to this category:\n Namespace operations (srmLs, srmMkdir, etc.) Discovery operation (srmPing) Space operations (srmReserveSpace, srmGetSpaceMetadata, etc.)  For this type of request, the FE perform a direct communication to the Backend using a RPC approach, based on the XML-RPC protocol. XML-RPC is a simple protocol to exchange XML structured data over HTTP. The Backend provides an XML-RPC server and the FE(s) acts as client. A worker threads in case of synchronous requests performs this steps:\n structure the SRM data in XML send a request to the BE XML-RPC server wait until the execution get result from XML and unmarshall it in SOAP return the control to the client  ","excerpt":"Pool of worker threads The FE uses a pool of worker threads to manage …","ref":"/storm-docs/docs/overview/frontend/","title":"StoRM Frontend"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.
